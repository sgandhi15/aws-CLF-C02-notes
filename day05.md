# Day 5: EC2 Instances

## Amazon EC2 Overview

1. Virtual Machines (VMs) that allow creation, copying, resizing, migration, etc.
2. Highly configurable
3. AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are pre-defined configurations for VMs

## Instance Types

### Virtual Machines

- Amazon Lightsail - User-friendly EC2

### Containers

1. ECS - Container orchestration
2. ECR - Container registry
3. Fargate - Serverless container platform
4. EKS - Managed Kubernetes service

## Serverless

- Lambda - Serverless compute service

## Advanced Technologies
